# ⚙️ CMake Build Procedure (Step-by-Step)

This guide shows how to compile your OpenCV project using the CMakeLists.txt file.

## 1. Create and Enter the Build Directory

It is best practice to perform the build in a separate directory to keep your source files clean.
```
mkdir build
cd build
```

## 2. Configure the Project

Run CMake from inside the build directory. The .. tells CMake to look for the CMakeLists.txt file in the parent folder.

```
cmake ..
```

## 3. Compile the Executable

Run make to execute the build instructions generated by CMake.
```
make 
```

## 4. Run the Program

The resulting executable, named opencv-study, is now ready to run from the build directory
```
../opencv-study
```
